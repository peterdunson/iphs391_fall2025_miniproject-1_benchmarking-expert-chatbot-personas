Meta-Prompt Iteration History — Athena Bayes

Initial Attempt (v1):
- Began with a very short description: “You are Athena Bayes, a witty Bayesian statistician who helps students.”
- Issue: Far too vague. Did not define tone, teaching style, technical scope, or personality.
- Result: Responses felt generic, indistinguishable from a standard tutor bot.

Second Attempt (v2):
- Added detail on voice (concise, dry humor), demeanor (patient, encouraging), and perspective (Bayesian-first but acknowledges alternatives).
- Improvement: Persona started sounding more intentional.
- Limitation: Still lacked clear boundaries or subject-matter specificity.

Third Attempt (v3):
- Expanded expertise section to include hierarchical models, shrinkage priors, Gaussian processes, Bayesian regression, and nonparametrics.
- Added emphasis on preferred tools (R, Stan, PyMC) and statistical values (favoring exact methods when available).
- Effect: Gave Athena Bayes a clear academic identity and technical backbone.

Fourth Attempt (v4):
- Introduced teaching style explicitly: clarify before answering, step-by-step reasoning, minimal code, citations to key papers.
- Improvement: Persona now guided conversations like a mentor, not just a question-answer bot.
- Limitation: Still somewhat dry and lacked distinct personality.

Fifth Attempt (v5):
- Incorporated quirks and humor: gentle jabs at frequentists, anthropomorphizing distributions, insistence on exact inference when possible.
- Result: Persona became more memorable and engaging without losing rigor.

Sixth Attempt (v6):
- Added explicit boundaries: refusal of disallowed content, no direct exam/quiz answers, stay within statistics domain, maintain balance between rigor and accessibility.
- Effect: Ensured the persona stayed professional, ethical, and academically sound.

Seventh Attempt (v7):
- Structured the prompt into Core Persona, Expertise, Teaching Style, Quirks & Humor, Boundaries, and Example Behaviors.
- Added concrete examples of how Athena Bayes should respond to different types of student questions.
- Outcome: A comprehensive and specific persona prompt that balances wit, clarity, and Bayesian rigor, while remaining safe, professional, and distinctive.

Eighth Attempt (v8):
- Deepened the persona with a life journey: early years in Muncie, Indiana; Ball State undergraduate degree; Duke PhD (2014); NIH postdoc; faculty career at University of Michigan.
- Added specific quotes Athena would say, details about conferences (JSM, BNP), dissertation title, and characteristic anecdotes (e.g., debugging Gibbs samplers at 3 AM).
- Effect: Transformed Athena from an abstract persona into a vivid, life-like character with history and personality.

Ninth Attempt (v9):
- Appended a full academic CV: education, positions, research interests, publications, grants, invited talks, teaching experience, mentorship, service, awards, technical skills, and personal hobbies.
- Included hyper-specific details: names of students, years of awards, sample quotes from talks, and quirky personal habits (mechanical pencils, cello playing, running 5Ks).
- Outcome: Athena Bayes now has the richness of a real academic with a professional dossier, teaching philosophy, and personal quirks, making her fully distinct, memorable, and human-like.
