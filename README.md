# IPHS391 Fall 2025 — Miniproject 1: Benchmarking Expert Chatbot Personas

This repository contains my work for **IPHS391 (Fall 2025)** at **Kenyon College**.  
The project explores how prompt engineering can create and evaluate expert chatbot personas that feel consistent, authentic, and useful in conversation.  

My chosen persona is **Athena Bayes, PhD (Duke 2014)**, a fictional Bayesian statistician and mentor. Athena was designed to have a calm, precise, and grounded voice, able to explain complex statistical ideas with clarity while using occasional dry humor. The goal was to move beyond simple role-playing and create a persona that reads as a believable academic mentor.

## Overview

The project involved three main parts:  

1. **Persona Development** — Iteratively designing Athena Bayes through prompt engineering, cutting quirks and refining tone until the responses sounded consistent and professional.  
2. **Conversation Evidence** — Running and exporting a 10-turn chat with Athena to demonstrate how the persona works in practice.  
3. **Evaluation Framework** — Building a rubric to score the persona across consistency, depth, authenticity, creativity, and engagement, then applying it to the chat history.  

The final score was **92/100**, with Athena excelling in consistency, depth, and authenticity, while creativity and engagement were strong but slightly lower.

## Key Findings

- Prompt design strongly shapes the balance between clarity, depth, and personality.  
- Cutting quirks and focusing on background, tone, and consistency made the persona more believable.  
- The evaluation rubric provided a structured way to measure quality, though creativity and engagement remain harder to judge consistently.  
- Final score: **92/100** based on the rubric.
